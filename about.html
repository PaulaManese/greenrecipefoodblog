Like a lot of kids he started out running a lemonade stand when he was six years old, but it didn’t stop there. By 18 he’d bought an ice cream truck, and later purchased a gas station. In 1989, Bisogno started Mr. Goodcents Subs & Pastas® in Lenexa, KS after nearly 10 years of experience with the McDonald’s Corp. He’d leveled up.--> <span class="first-character">H</span>ere we cook and eat healthy and simple vegetarian food with natural ingredients, whole grains, good fats, fruit and vegetables.</p>

                    <p class="margin-top-10">Now known as GREEN RECIPE GROUP, Bisogno’s vision lives on: our company offers heathy dine-in, drive-thru, carry-out and delivery of SOUP, PASTAS AND SUBMARINE SANDWICHES  ranging from traditional turkey, ham and cheese or meatball, to specialties like the Penny Club®, which features turkey, ham, and roast beef.

                      We are organised into three commercial functions: media, products & licensing and restaurants — as well as an in-house campaigns team.

                      We strive to provide a happy, healthy workplace and believe it’s important that our employees are able to enjoy a great work-life balance and active lifestyles. 
                      
                      Our open culture and ways of working support our highly engaged teams to apply their creative talents to help our audiences overcome barriers around cooking, shopping and eating better. We also invest heavily in staff training, to ensure each employee has the opportunity to develop both professionally and personally.

                    <p class="margin-top-10">To become a B Corp, the business was assessed and audited against rigorous standards of social and environmental performance, accountability and transparency. The Green Recipe Group has always held social impact at its heart – from campaigning for a better food system, advocating high food and animal welfare standards, to creating a happy, healthy and inclusive workplace. 

                      The certification is recognition of the high standards the group upholds, plus it gives us the ideal framework to pursue our campaign goal of halving childhood obesity by 2030. 
                      
                      We are proud to have joined a growing group of companies around the world that use business as a force for good. Together, we can speed up progress towards reducing inequality, lowering levels of poverty, improving our environment, strengthening communities, and creating more high quality jobs with dignity and purpose. We see great potential in working with the wider B Corp community to learn and share best practice, as we look for new solutions to some of the greatest challenges of our time.</p>

This means eating from all of the food groups in the Eatwell Guide. There’s a place for all kinds of food in our diet – we don’t label foods as ‘good’ or ‘bad’ – it’s about how often and how much and understanding the difference between nutritious ‘everyday’ foods and ‘occasional’ foods such as cake and pastries.</p>

                    <p class="margin-top-10">Our everyday recipes contain at least three of the food groups and one portion of veg (at the very least). They must contain less than 30% of the average recommended daily calories, saturated fat, sugar and salt. We monitor portion size and make sure recipes are within the green or amber colour-coded scale for saturated fat, salt and sugar.
                      <br>We base our standards on government nutrition guidelines, and support Public Health England’s sugar, salt and calorie reformulation targets for key product categories. We have specific guidelines for recipes and dishes for children, which (in the absence of Reference Intakes for children) are based on previous GDAs and School Food Standards.
